> ### What you‚Äôll learn
- This glossary contains explain used technologies and terms in the Canarytrace ecosystem.

### TTFB
- time, when first byte from response arrived to browser net stack.

### Response Times
- Time, when the entire response, including body, arrived at the browser

### Performance Entries
- Performance entries is a collection of a single performance metric that is part of the performance timeline.
- [Performance Entry documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceEntry)

### Load Event End
- Time, when is current loading complete. Canarytrace awaits this event. After this event it's possible to perform next operations in the monitor script e.g. `titleElm.waitForExist(‚Ä¶)`
- [PerformanceNavigationTiming.loadEventEnd documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceNavigationTiming/loadEventEnd)

### entryType: navigation
- Collects performance metrics for HTML documents.
- [W3C Navigation timing](https://w3c.github.io/navigation-timing/)
- [Assessing Loading Performance in Real Life with Navigation and Resource Timing](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/navigation-and-resource-timing)

### entryType: resource
- Collects performance metrics for document-dependent resources. Stuff like style sheets, scripts, images, etc.
- [W3C Resource timing](https://w3c.github.io/resource-timing/)
- [Assessing Loading Performance in Real Life with Navigation and Resource Timing](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/navigation-and-resource-timing)

### Test Case / Monitor script
- It‚Äôs the same code / file. In the world of functional testing is used terms Test Case, but for management and other colleagues is better to use term monitor script.
- Example with test case saved to smoke.js  @todo

### Hero Elements
- It‚Äôs a method for accurate measurement when and what is displayed for the user.
- Hero Elements @todo

### DOMHighResTimeStamp
- The time, given in milliseconds, should be accurate to 5 ¬µs (microseconds), with the fractional part of the number indicating fractions of a millisecond. However, if the browser is unable to provide a time value accurate to 5 ¬µs (due, for example, to hardware or software constraints), the browser can represent the value as a time in milliseconds accurate to a millisecond. [Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp)

- Use for [Performance Entries](https://canarytrace.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CDD/pages/192315512/Performance+Entries) and Hero Elements @todo
