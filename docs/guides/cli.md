You can use AWS_S3_BUCKET option for upload screenshot to AWS S3 This option is described below.

You can use -e CAPTURE_EVERY_SCREEN=allow for make screenshot on every test step.

AVAILABILITY_CHECK default no run before test runner curl command with BASE_URL value. E.g. -e AVAILABILITY_CHECK=allow

It's useful for check availability environment and tested application.

What happens when I use the options for the professional version in the developer version

Some options for Canarytrace professional they will have no effect.

Services such as PT_AUDIT, RESPONSE_INTERCEPT etc. are marked in stdout such as allowed e.g.


# Services allowed only for professional version used in developer version

[0-0] Canarytrace:enablePerformanceAudits:allowed
[0-0] testStepStart: HomePage open
[0-0] Canarytrace:CoverageStart:allowed
[0-0] Canarytrace:EvaluatePerformanceAudit:allowed
[0-0] Canarytrace:TakeCoverage:allowed
[0-0] testStepEnd: HomePage open (2419 ms)
[0-0] PASSED in chrome - /tmp/canary-tests/tesla/smoke.js
This is useful for prepare test case for Canarytrace Professional.
