> ### What you‚Äôll learn
- What is Canarytrace
- Key features

## In a nutshell

Canarytrace is a Plug‚Äôn'Play stack for testing, monitoring availability of web application from user perspective and measurement performance metrics [web performance testing](/docs/references/glosary#web-performance-testing) .
Web applications are tested with functional frameworks ( [functional testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_testing) ) and by lot of performance tools ( [performance testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_performance_testing) )

### We make it possible to:

Set up tests
Write tests
Run tests
Debug Tests
Cypress is most often compared to Selenium; however Cypress is both fundamentally and architecturally different. Cypress is not constrained by the same restrictions as Selenium.

This enables you to write faster, easier and more reliable tests.
