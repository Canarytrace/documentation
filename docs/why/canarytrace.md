> ### What you‚Äôll learn
- What is Canarytrace
- Key features

## In a nutshell

Canarytrace is a Plug‚Äôn'Play stack for testing, monitoring availability of web application from user perspective and measurement performance metrics ( [web performance testing](/docs/references/glosary#web-performance-testing) ).

Web applications are tested with functional frameworks ( [functional testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_testing) ) and by performance tools ( [performance testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_performance_testing) ). None of these approaches test performance and behavior of browser.

Browser on desktop or mobile device is a small infrastructure and has different performance and behavior according on resources (eg. CPU, RAM) depending on the device, condition of network and by quality of web application.

Canarytrace is first stack for in-depth analysis behavior of browser and measure performance web application from end of user perspective.


## Key features

- **Analyzes more than 60 metrics**: Canarytrace collection a lot of telemetry data from real browser (not headless) as used by the user.

- **Credible results**: Testing and measurement is performed with fixed sources for the browser - there is no distortion of metrics. The results will tell you the real state your web application and the impact on your client.

- **Workload model**: You can run more Canarytrace instances with different profile of devices, with different scenarios (user journey) and with different behavior of simulated user.

- **Browser based performance testing**: If is hard perform load testing your web application by traditional performance tools, for Canarytrace it's easy, because we uses a real browser. You can run a huge number of virtual users.

- **Live reporting**: Canarytrace store immediately telemetry data from a browser. Be the first to know if your application is unavailable or the loading speed slows down

- **Plug‚Äôn'Play stack**: [Architecture of Canarytrace](http://localhost:3000/docs/guides/architecture) is designed by Iac ( [Infrastructure as code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) ) principles. Canarytrace and additional components is [Dockerized](/docs/features/docker). Very fast onboarding. Very fast deployment of Canarytrace - no lengthy deployment procedures.
Deploying to cloud providers such as [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/), or your [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) etc. is matter of the moment.

- **Maintenance free**:
