> ### What you‚Äôll learn
- What is Canarytrace
- Key features

## In a nutshell

Canarytrace is a Plug‚Äôn'Play stack for testing, monitoring availability of web application from user perspective and measurement performance metrics ( [web performance testing](/docs/references/glosary#web-performance-testing) ).

Web applications are tested with functional frameworks ( [functional testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_testing) ) and by performance tools ( [performance testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_performance_testing) ). None of these approaches test performance and behavior of browser.

Browser on desktop or mobile device is a small infrastructure and has different performance and behavior according on resources (eg. CPU, RAM) depending on the device, condition of network and by quality of web application.

Canarytrace is first stack for in-depth analysis behavior of browser and measure performance web application from end of user perspective.


## Key features

- **Analyzes more than 60 metrics**: Canarytrace collection a lot of telemetry data from real browser (not headless) as used by the user.

- **Credible results**: Testing and measurement is performed with fixed sources for the browser - there is no distortion of metrics. The results will tell you the real state your web application and the impact on your client.

- **Workload model**: You can run more Canarytrace instances with different profile of devices, with different scenarios (user journey) and with different behavior of simulated user.

- **Browser based performance testing**: If is hard perform load testing your web application by traditional performance tools, for Canarytrace it's easy, because we uses a real browser. You can run a huge number of virtual users.

- **Live reporting**: Canarytrace store immediately telemetry data from a browser. Be the first to know if your application is unavailable or the loading speed slows down

- **Plug‚Äôn'Play stack**: [Architecture of Canarytrace](http://localhost:3000/docs/guides/architecture) is designed by Iac ( [Infrastructure as code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) ) principles. Canarytrace and additional components is [Dockerized](/docs/features/docker). Very fast onboarding. Very fast deployment of Canarytrace - no lengthy deployment procedures.
Deploying to cloud providers such as [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/), or your [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) etc. is matter of the moment.

- **Maintenance free**: Only set list of landing pages e.g. `https://canarytrace.com/;https://canarytrace.com/docs` that's all. Canarytrace automatically analysing lot of metrics from every landing page. 

- **Testing and monitoring web application during development**: Thanks maintenance free you can testing and measure lot of metrics durring development or during switchnig on new version of web application - early testing.

- **Check landing page every 1min**: Canarytrace test and measure your landing page very ofen, e.g. every 1min or every 3min etc. Thanks to this, it catches a lots of errors. Very frequent measurements are useful for immediate and more accurate overview on realy state of your web application.

- **From user perspective**: Canarytrace use a real browser (not headless). Thanks to is results such as of real world. 

- You will be first to know (alerting)

- With 5 ¬µs accuracy

- Hero Element

- Performance audit

- integration with your tools
